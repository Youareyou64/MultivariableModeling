# VAMMS - Vertically Actuated Multivariable Modeling System

A Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Engineering Development and Design project by **[Jack Sloan](https://github.com/Youareyou64), Shawn Johnson, and Matthew Wincek**.

## Purpose

Designed to utilize a CNC style XY gantry to actuate a set of points to physically model equations in the form z=f(x,y).

This is designed to be a superior alternative to digital solutions for visualizing 3-dimensional graphs and surfaces. 

## Hardware

This project is designed to utilize a repurposed 3D printer mainboard (SKR Mini e3 v3) and three NEMA-17 stepper motors controlled via serial connection by a Raspberry Pi.
